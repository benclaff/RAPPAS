v1.1

+ added full support for nucleotide/amino acids ambiguities.
  !! This major change breaks compatibility with previous versions. !!
  !! It will also produce slightly different placement scores. !!
+ phyml version is now explicitely tested before execution to ensure compatibility
+ when a user uses an unrooted tree, he has now to explicitely confirm this choice as root choice may impact accuracy
- you do not anymore to define the states (-s) in placement phase, as this information is now saved in the database.
* bugfix related to some phantom branch lengths that were incorrect

v1.05
+ option to output a jplace with same column order than in pplacer, making the output compatible with guppy
+ some refactoring to simplify the DB code
+ added onlyX1 debug option
* corrected an important bug introduced in v1.04 where distal and pendant length were flipped in the jplace output

v1.04
+ added options to set more easily the model used during AR (options -m,-a,-c)
+ added --arparameters options to pass parameters directly to the AR software (useful for phyML tuning) 
* options -a (alpha) renamed -o (omega) to avoid confusion with Gamma shape parameters

v1.03
+ added UOX amino acids support (option --convertUOX)
* bugfix related to incorrect null verbosity (-v -1)


v1.02
+ support of platypi interactions

v1.01
+ makes clear that gap jumps are activated by default when gap ratio >=30%
* rewrote the command help (-h) to make it more clear
